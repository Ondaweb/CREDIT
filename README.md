# CREDIT
A program (based on a theory of reinforcement learning) that simulates an organism learning to find its way through a four choice points maze to a reward provided only at the end of one particular sequence of choices.  Since no external are stimuli are modeled/presented to the model nervous system, the fact that the simulation soon learns the correct path strongly suggests the theory provides a solution to the "credit assignment problem".
